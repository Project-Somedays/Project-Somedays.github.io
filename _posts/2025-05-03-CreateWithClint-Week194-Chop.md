| 🤯 Concept      | Chop bot used chop! It's highly effective...   |
| 🔎 Focus        | Perfect loop + efficiency of animation - one chop motion and offset the timing. Explode for the section of the tree he hacks off. |

## 🎓Lessons Learned🎓
- Item 1

## Resources:
- ["Junk Wheel" model by Rex Hans on BlenderKit](https://www.blenderkit.com/asset-gallery-detail/16c92522-68f7-4a86-acea-de5ab230e70c/)
- ["Lumberjack Flannel" material by NK Productions on BlenderKit](https://www.blenderkit.com/asset-gallery-detail/116973d9-ca12-439b-9200-f114d59d067e/)
- Axe Model from BlenderKit

## Stretch Goals/Extension Ideas
- [ ] Constrain the rotation of the wheel with distance travelled?

## TODO:
### Scenework
- [x] Layout Basic Scene
- [x] Background
- [ ] Sound design
- [ ] Looping background?

### Camera Biz
- [x] Set up vertical camera
- [x] Lock camera to Chop Bot

### Blocking
- [x] Block out the four phases: Tree gets taken away --> move to the next tree --> chop --> tree falls
- [x] Timeline Markers

### Lighting
- [x] Set up sun lighting so it doesn't change in the loop

### Modelling
- [x] Rough version of the Lumberjack Chop Bot
- [x] Texturing
- [ ] Refinement

### Animation - Chop Bot

- [x] Markers on key points in the animation
- [x] Rotation on the wheel
- [x] Set up eye movement
- [x] Constrain the top half to match the rotation of the pivotControl
- [ ] Rig the arms
- [ ] Chop cycle

### Animation - Tree Fall
- [ ] Simulate tree falling over --> keyframes


# 🪵Dev Log🪵

## 2025-04-05 Basic blockout 🕒1.5hrs
  - Made chop bot  
  
  ![Needs more chest...](/assets/images/2025-05-03_ChopBot.png "I doubt the final version will be radically different")

  - Made chopped down tree
  
  ![Need to make low-poly rougher](/assets/images/2025-05-03_ChopBotTree.png "Is pencil?");

## 2025-04-05 Finishin off the overall animation  🕒1hr
  - Sorted out the base animation
  - Sorted out the rotation
  - Chucked in the timeline markers (SO HANDY)
  - Eyes now look at the next tree before moving there
  - Camera now locked to the movement
  - Maybe it's all a bit fast? Can slow everything down later
