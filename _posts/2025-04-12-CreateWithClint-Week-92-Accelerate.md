## TODO:
- [ ] Learn about soft body sims
- [ ] Do a quick monkey head jello test
- [ ] Block out scene
  - [ ] Rough sketch
  - [ ] Rough blockout in clay render mode
  - [ ] Camera moves
- [ ] Model an elephant seal? Could be a fun sculpting problem
  - [ ] Rough shapes
  - [ ] Refinement
- [ ] Elephant seal awkwardly in car
  - [ ] Find a suitable cartoony
  - [ ] Start soft body sim before the render starts

## Stretch Goals/Extension Ideas

# Things I've learned



# 🪵Dev Log🪵

## 2025-04-02 First Steps - Reference, Sketch and Soft body sim test 🕒1hr
- Watched a few videos
- Found some references of Elephant Seals - I think I'm onto something here
- Tried to replicate some animation/soft body sim  but couldn't work it out... 😤 Time for a break 😅

## 2025-04-13 🕒1hr
- Set up soft body on a clown fish... Ok. I think we're getting somewhere... 😊

## 2025-04-16 🕒1.5hr
- Thought about making a short film about pneumatic tubes
- Someone turns up the power and I could do a bunch of physics sims
- Made this test render... WAY more moody than I was actually going for but  I like the setup

![Note to self: make the lighting more corporate office-like](/assets/images/2025-04-14_TestRender.jpeg)

## 2025-04-16 🕒1hr
- Pivoting wildly... Thought about looking at Bloodhounds having their faces pulled back
- Tried modelling a bloodhound. Gave up almost immediately 🤣
- Went back to pneumatic tubes
  - Learned about collection instances: CTRL+G to join parts together in a collection and then you can instance that collection 
  - Was trying to follow-curve but having weird issues with scale? Maybe it's the things
- Epiphany!
  - What's doable? Original idea where we can have cars in a traffic jam... It's a ton of people with their heads out the windows of their cars. Lots of soft-body physics going on.
  - A lady with a necklace
  - An old guy with a stupidly long beard
  - A proboscus monkey
  - An elephant seal
  - A tapir
  - An elephant
- Hooray!
