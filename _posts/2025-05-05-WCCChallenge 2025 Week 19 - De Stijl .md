| ðŸ”Ž Focus        | Partitions and scaling by custom points    |

Started in 3D then realised I'd bitten off more than I could chew and switched back to sweet sweet familiar ground: p5js ðŸ¥°

## ðŸŽ“Lessons LearnedðŸŽ“
- Item 1

## Resources:


## Stretch Goals/Extension Ideas


## TODO:
- [x] Cube
- [x] Function to scale from a pivot point
- [ ] Function to scale from a pivot point in one dimension at a time
- [ ] Move pivot points around to the corners and to midpoints along edges
- [ ] Encapsulate the scaling and debugging in a class?
- [ ] Dynamically set the strokeweight
- [ ] Fix the final overlap problem


# ðŸªµDev LogðŸªµ

## 2025-05-05 Step 1: Custom scaling 9:00 - 10:00 ðŸ•’1hr
  - Step 1: Set the pivot point for custom scaling

  ```
  /**
 * Enhanced smoothstep with steeper transition (more dramatic curve)
 * @param {THREE.Object3D} body - the mesh to be scaled
 * @param {THREE.Vector3} origin - the original position of the mesh  
 * @param {THREE.Vector3} pivot - The input value
 * @param {number} scl - Power to raise the smoothstep result to (higher = steeper)
 * @param {boolean} showCornerMarker - for debugging purposes
 * @returns {number} - Smoothly interpolated value between 0 and 1 with steeper transition
 */
function scaleFromPt(body, origin, pivot, scl, showCornerMarker){
    if(showCornerMarker){
        cornerMarker.visible = true;
        cornerMarker.position.copy(pivot);
    } else{
        cornerMarker.visible = false;
    }
    body.scale.setScalar(scl)
    const translation = new THREE.Vector3().copy(pivot).multiplyScalar(1 - scl);
    cube.position.copy(origin).add(translation);
}
```

## 2025-05-09 Pivoting to the 2D version for doability ðŸ•’2hr
- Started with just a grid

![Biz](/assets/images/2025-05-10_DuStijl_Start.png)

- Looping through and deciding if it's a 1 or 2 step in the x and y and, if so, excluding those points in future

![Biz2](/assets/images/2025-05-10_deStijl_Hmmm.png)

- Hmmm a lot of overlap I'm seeing... must be missing excluding some points...

![Biz3](/assets/images/2025-05-10_deStijl_Fixed.png)

- Aha! It was the middle point in cases of step 2 in the x and y! 
- Also, changing it so that it ends at the bounds
- Also shifting it with translate to centre on the canvas
