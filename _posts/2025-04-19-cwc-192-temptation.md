- Found an awesome free dog model in exactly the style I'm after

![So cute!](/assets/images/2025-04-19_DogModel.png)

- Found a neat burger model that doesn't QUITE match the aesthetic but it's a very decent stand-in in the meantime

![Makes me hungry](/assets/images/2025-04-19_BurderModel.png)

- Framing the shot with cubes as stand-ins for the dog shoulder angels

![I'm sure this will change MANY times](/assets/images/2025-04-19%20Framing.png)

- Started texturing the doggo after decimating the mesh to 20%

![This will take a little while](/assets/images/2025-04-19%20Begin%20Texturing.png)

- Set up basic IK bone rig for adding just a little bit of life my render

![Rigging - EVENTUALLY it'll make more sense... I hope...](/assets/images/2025-04-19%20Rigging%20for%20basic%20animation.png)
