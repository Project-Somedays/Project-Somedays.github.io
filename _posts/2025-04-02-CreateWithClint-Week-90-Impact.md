Started from scratch a couple of times

## Stretch Goals/Extension Ideas

## TODO:
- [x] Sketch
- [x] Globe Sim
- [x] Globe cell fracture


## Things I've learned
- Collections is how the physics sim knows which objects should interact
- Substeps per frame: 130, Solver interations: 40
- If you start objects overlapping, everything freaks out
- Convex hulls don't fit convex parts of 3D models very well

## 2025-04-02 First Steps - Isolate skills ðŸ•’2hrs
- Played around scale... This was a mistake RE physics sims ðŸ˜…
- Got thoroughly confused why my simulations kept exploding. Or doing zero things.

## 2025-04-05 Finishing before the deadline ðŸ•’1.5hrs
- Started from scratch
- Final edit and transitions in Premier
