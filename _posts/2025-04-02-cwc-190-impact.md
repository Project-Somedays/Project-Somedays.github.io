| 🖥️Rig Deets     | 24GB RAM, 13th Gen Core i9, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 |

## 🎓Lessons Learned🎓
- Collections is how the physics sim knows which objects should interact
- Substeps per frame: 130, Solver interations: 40
- If you start objects overlapping, everything freaks out
- Convex hulls don't fit convex parts of 3D models very well

# 🪵Dev Log🪵

## 2025-04-02 First Steps - Isolate skills 🕒2hrs
- Played around scale... This was a mistake RE physics sims 😅
- Got thoroughly confused why my simulations kept exploding. Or doing zero things.

## 2025-04-05 Finishing before the deadline 🕒1.5hrs
- Started from scratch
- Final edit and transitions in Premier
