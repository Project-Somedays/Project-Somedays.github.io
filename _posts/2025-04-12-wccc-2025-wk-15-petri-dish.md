## The Algorithm
For cells as a whole
1. Identify a target somewhere on the Petri Dish
2. Set a interTarget in that direction, but maxStep away
3. Lerp to that interTarget and update again

Cell are made up of perimeter points based on the location of the cell.

Each time we retarget the main cell:

4. So that the closest points move first, calculate a delay based on how a perimeter point is away from the target.
5. Throughout the transition from src to target, each perimeter point finds it place on a circle that gets smaller in the middle so that it looks like it sqeezes in a little
6. To draw the cell, connect up the points ðŸ˜Ž

## Stretch Goals/Extension Ideas
- [ ] Make the perimeter of each cell irregular with noise
- [ ] Set the path from src to target not so directly
- [ ] Add lil-gui sliders to play with variables
- [ ] Avoid passing through other cells
- [ ] Implement in 3D


# ðŸŽ“Lessons LearnedðŸŽ“
- Tackling one problem at a time is ALWAYS the way to go: https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2612804

## 2025-04-12 18:00 - 18:30:00 ðŸ•’0.5hrs
- First pass at getting things moving around the screen on a cycle

## 2025-04-13 Breaking it down
- Started over with [this sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/projectsomedays/sketches/mCCZHt-IB) to just focus on getting the transitions

- Integrated it with the main code base awkwardly [here](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2612804):
