## Stretch Goals/Extension Ideas
- [ ] Adapt metamere's template to fix the window fit issue
- [ ] Try just using an image texture with transparency for the hole in the plane so you can get the torn paper look
- [ ] Crinkle the paper a bit

## TODO:
- [x] Basic setup
- [x] Get a setup of concentric toruses
- [x] Import opensimplexnoise and write a mapping function
- [x] Vibe code imperfect toruses: [https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2604884](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2604884)
- [x] Scratch head why this doesn't quite seemed to have matched the result from that sketch
- [x] Shrug and move on
- [x] Add in local rotation
- [x] Vibe code the frame with a hole in it
- [x] Call it a day

# ðŸŽ“Lessons LearnedðŸŽ“
- mesh.geometry.attribute.position.array is a big old 1D array in Threejs of positional data that gets passed to the GPU if you call .needsUpdate = true
- It's soooo worth it to make a new mini-project when you want to try out a new technique BEFORE you try and integrate it into a more complicated project
- Reverse-Engineering: such a great way to learn and develop your own taste and sensibilities

## 2025-03-31 Building up slowly ðŸ•’1.5hrs
  - Step 1: get a torus on the screen
  ![Torus: Check](/assets/images/2025-03-31-TorusStage1.jpg "If I've learned anything, it's start REALLY simple and build on solid ground")
  - Step 2: Nest Torii
  ![Torus: Check](/assets/images/2025-03-31-TorusStage2.jpg "One step at a time")
  - Step 3: Make a bunch of them and make them move around a bit with opensimplexnoise
  ![Torus: Check](/assets/images/2025-03-31-TorusStage3.jpg "OK we're defs getting somewhere now...");

## 2025-04-06 Final run ðŸ•’2hrs
  - Looked into a template by Metamere to properly host my three.js code in OpenProcessing
  - Adapted code from "What happened to my donut" to slightly distort each torus
  - Made the adapted code run with 4D noise given it will be used just once at setup
  - Added local rotation to each set of discs
  - Vibe coded a hole in a plane and positioned it as the frame
