### Experimental workflow - planning out the short durations... ended up just timing it to the music

|Complete | Shot   | Type     | Duration | Cumulative Frames | Description                    |
| :----:  | :----: | :----:   | :----:   | :----        | :----:                              |
|  [x]    | 1      | Wide     | 150f     | 150f         |ISS + Earth |
|  [x]    | 2      | Medium   | 150f     | 300f         |Tunnel to bathroom with cool twisty motion |
|  [x]    | 3      | CU       | 5s/120f  |              |Astronaut in toilet front on --> Astronaut + Window --> Astronaut + Buttons. Looks from button to button and presses "Eject" |

|  [x]    | 6      | CU       | 5s/120f  |              | Looks Falorn |


## Things I've learned
- **Cloth sims**
  - how good (though none made it in the final thing)
- **Timeline Biz**
  - Press 'm' to make markers in the timeline and then CTRL+B to bind the active camera to the marker
  - Press CTRL+Num 0 to set the selected camera to active
- **Weight Painting Biz**
  - Weight Painting = determines how much a bone will influence a vertex
  - Automatic weights struggles a bit with items like straps.
  - Select a vertex in the group
  - In Edit Mode, look at the influence data and set it to zero where it's being inappropriately controlled
  - With that vertex active, CTRL+Numpad+ to increase selection and hit copy to sever the connections
    - This is SO much easier than Weight painting where it's too easy to accidentally miss a vertex here and ther
    - Getting into it is confusing. Select mesh THEN select rig so it's active THEN hit CTRL+TAB to bring up the Weight Painting menu 🤔
- **Overall Workflow Biz**
  - Blender slows down significantly on my current rig - I should do all my blocking in clay render mode THEN texture biz later
  - Need a way to see the keyframes in audio in the Video Sequencer. I'll go digging. Or maybe I'm just supposed to use the Graph view
  - Do lots of little test renders. Not only does it help with the feeling of progress, but it makes for handy socials content as you go.
  - Render as you go - once signed off on a scene, render it for later editing. No need to save that until the end. Especially on my poor old PC 😅


# 🪵Dev Log🪵

## 2025-04-02 First Steps - Story-boarding, gathering ref 🕒4hrs
- Story-boarding:
![Storyboard part 1](/assets/images/2025-04-05-Lone_Storyboard_Page_1.jpg)
![Storyboard part 2](/assets/images/2025-04-05-Lone_Storyboard_Page_2.jpg)
- Started learning cloth sims
- TP and book test done!
![TP test](/assets/images/2025-04-05_Lone_ClothSimTest.png)

## 2025-04-06 Finish blocking, music and sound effectsd 🕒2hrs
- Finished block out
- Established other cameras
- Made little scenes for other astronauts
- Made choices about the ending: sad, then reads Farside
- Retimed for the music

## 2025-04-07 Rigging the character 🕒2hrs
- Found an EXCELLENT tutorial (see resources above) to help me with weird rigging issues where his straps would go nuts whenever I lifted the arms that was baffling
- Set up rig and fixed vertex weightings
- Practiced with a really simple space man animation to music

## 2025-04-08 Bringing in the rigged character 🕒 2hrs
- Fixed some camera motion
- Learned to append my character from my test footage
- Made him lean over to wipe his butt
- Made him look at the buttons at the end of the wipe
- Learned about the importance of markers for syncing different animations and sounds etc
- Decided that the astronauts should be holding a sprouting potato and clipboard and measuring tape (which can have a cloth sim on it also) --> headtrack their movement
- Animated pressing the button
- Considering tightening the timing on everything but I've basically run out of time
- Leaning into cheating because ultimately it's about what's in camera, right?

Render View

![What they see](/assets/images/2025-04-10_Lone_ButtonPress.jpg)

Working View 😅

![What I see](/assets/images/2025-04-10_Lone_ButtonPress2.jpg)

## 2025-04-10 8:00 Clean rigging and posing in another blender file 🕒1hr
- Rigged and posed in MUCH faster time = very satisfying
- Now to position them in
- Tried using a bone constraint to track the path of the toilet module, but gave up on that.
- Test render: vampire potato

![Why you no see the potato in the reflection??](/assets/images/2025-04-10_SpacePotato.png)

## 2025-04-10 17:20 Tightening up timeline and bringing elements together --> render time 🕒2hr
- Tightened up timing and synced action with the music
- Sorted out issues with the GLTF scene not being able to be appended properly
- Brought in my measurement bois

![I like this view](/assets/images/2025-04-11%20Lone.jpg)

## 2025-04-11 22:00 Ooft out of time!
- Discovered that I had my settings wrong for the outdoor scenes and my poor laptop (with a more powerful GPU) rendered for a good 9 hrs and only go through 100 of the 750 frames I was hoping for
- Ended up submitting the clay render version so I got something in for the weekly
- Note to self: render as you go and stitch together later

## 2025-04-12 Final edit
- Stitched the two versions together and pushed it out the door!
