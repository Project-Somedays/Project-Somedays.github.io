Bit off more than I could chew with some very unfamiliar ground to cover but learned a LOT.

Gemini was my tutor - I asked it lots of questions rather than relying on it to write my code - only half the time the tutor was getting it wrong... 

So, pretty much like a REAL tutor ü§£ 

## üéìLessons Learnedüéì
- When you've baked the texture in blender, you need to make sure each material channel has an image texture node referencing the texture you're baking to
- Make sure your uv unwrap has a bit of an island offset
- How to add audio! Not too bad. Lots of boilerplate, but pretty straightforward. According to Gemini you can add positional sound in your scene. Three.js is NUTS.

## Stretch Goals/Extension Ideas
- [ ] Tilt the saucer when moving in any given direction
- [ ] Make the controls MUCH smoother... basic physics probably so it's a bit tricky with overshooting
- [ ] Make a safe zone to mark when alpacas have craftily escaped...
- [ ] Different levels with faster sheep/alpacas

## TODO:
### Models
- [x] Set up a template
- [x] Find a sheep model
- [x] Adapt for alpaca
- [x] Bring into three.js
- [x] Get a walk cycle sorted
- [x] Import UFO
- [x] Make it spin
- [x] Bake the UFO texture

### Code Structure/Biz
- [x] Refactor so we can work with TWO instancedMeshes
- [x] Work with Promises because loading

### Controls
- [x] UFO Controls with arrow keys
- [ ] Smooth out motion
- [x] Move the camera to a starting position off to the side at the right height to see the saucer

### Gameplay
- [x] Work out abduction reset
- [x] Choose initial animals in positions by Math.random() < alpacaRatio
- [ ] Update biz
- [ ] Scoring
- [ ] Display scoring?
- [ ] Set up an end zone?

### Audio
- [x] Add ambient sheep audio
- [x] Add abduction sound
- [x] Add ambient spaceship sound

## 2025-04-19 Most of the build... (or so I thought)
  - Alpacas are just stretch sheep, right? 
  
  ![Blender biz](/assets/images/wccc/2025-wk16-filter/2025-04-19_StretchSheep.png "Seems legit üòÖ")

  - Baking textures. Took a little bit to get my head around, but now it's so handy...

  - InstancedMesh for the win

  - Changed the starting perspective and checked the alpacas... Hooray!

## 2025-04-20 Refactoring and finishing
- Quite a bit of refactoring to work with TWO instancedmeshes
- Refactoring for promises
- Worked out how to distribute the alpacas among the sheep
- Worked out how to import the textures with the refactored code
- Added a html element to track scoring
- Added REALLY rudimentary scoring mechanic
