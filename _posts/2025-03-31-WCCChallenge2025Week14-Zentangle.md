## Resources:
- 

## Stretch Goals/Extension Ideas
- [ ] Swirl the parts around artistically with open simplex noise
- [ ] Look at a bunch of different machines that would be cool to explode
- [ ] Explode extent controls

## TODO:
- [x] Basic setup
- [x] Get a setup of concentric toruses
- [x] Import opensimplexnoise
- [x] Vibe code imperfect toruses
- [ ] Set r by position in 3D space?

## Things I've learned
- Item 1

## 2025-03-31 Building up slowly
  - Step 1: get a torus on the screen
  ![Torus: Check](/assets/images/2025-03-31-TorusStage1.jpg "If I've learned anything, it's start REALLY simple and build on solid ground")
  - Step 2: Nest Torii
  ![Torus: Check](/assets/images/2025-03-31-TorusStage2.jpg "One step at a time")
  - Step 3: Make a bunch of them and make them move around a bit with opensimplexnoise
