## Stretch Goals/Extension Ideas
- [ ] Swirl the parts around artistically with open simplex noise
- [ ] Look at a bunch of different machines that would be cool to explode
- [ ] Explode extent controls

## TODO:
### Models
- [x] Set up a template
- [x] Find a sheep model
- [x] Adapt for alpaca
- [x] Bring into three.js
- [x] Get a walk cycle sorted
- [x] Import UFO
- [x] Make it spin
- [ ] Bake the UFO texture

### Controls
- [x] UFO Controls with arrow keys
- [ ] Smooth out motion
- [x] Move the camera to a starting position off to the side at the right height to see the saucer

### Gameplay
- [x] Work out abduction reset
- [ ] Replace some sheep with alpacas by setting the scale for those sheep to 0?
- [ ] Scoring
- [ ] Display scoring?
- [ ] Set up an end zone?

### Audio
- [x] Add ambient sheep audio
- [x] Add abduction sound
- [x] Add ambient spaceship sound

## Things I've learned
- When you've baked the texture in blender, you need to make sure each material channel has an image texture node referencing the texture you're baking to
- Make sure your uv unwrap has a bit of an island offset
- How to add audio! Not too bad. Lots of boilerplate, but pretty straightforward. According to Gemini you can add positional sound in your scene. Three.js is NUTS.

## 2025-04-19 One and done
  - Alpacas are just stretch sheep, right?

  - Baking textures. Took a little bit to get my head around, but now it's so handy...

  - InstancedMesh for the win

  - Changed the starting perspective and checked the alpacas... Hooray!
