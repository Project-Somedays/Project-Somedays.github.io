## Stretch Goals/Extension Ideas
- [ ] Animation or at least soft body physics on the other tentacles
- [ ] Work out how to parent the... well I guess you just attach a vertex group to the pole to get the tip of the tentacle to move with the bindle... Do that 😊

  - First pass at a cute octopus 
  ![Basic scene as a test](/assets/images/2025-05-30_Octopus.png)

## 2025-05-30 20:00 - 2025-05-31 00:30 🙄 Smashing the rest out

  - Made a coral stick using a BlenderKit texture and kitbashing from SketchFab

  - Adding suckers with the sculpt tool and masking: love it!

  - Rigging and Posing a Tentacle

- Shape Key Right Eye

- Found a hyper-stylised work van, modified Jacques the cleaner shrimp from Finding Nemo JUST enough and slapped it clumsily on the side using a UV Image Texture

![Work van](/assets/images/2025-05-30_Octopus_LogoDesign.png)

- Brought in a Coastal HDRI from Blender Kit for some lovely atmospheric lighting. Tried a couple of different ground plane setups, but ultimately I'd just run out of time for the 2AM Australian time deadline

- Keyframed some really basic camera moves, pausing on the beats - probably could have used a LITTLE more time on the side of the van to let the viewer read it - but I didn't want to lose momentum. Would I tighten it up a little? YES! At the end of the day, projects are never finished, just published. Moving on!
