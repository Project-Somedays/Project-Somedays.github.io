## ðŸŽ“Lessons LearnedðŸŽ“
- OBJ doesn't store the initial positional data in ways that are easy to work with apparently??
- THREE.js is SO much more complex than p5js. Which I already knew, but I've worked in p5 for so long, I'd forgotten how many niceties is has. Like handling mouse presses etc.

## Resources:
- "Typewriter" by Metro on Sketchfab: [https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/typewriter-c212b517cbdd4fa1930ed31a45670d39](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/typewriter-c212b517cbdd4fa1930ed31a45670d39)

## Stretch Goals/Extension Ideas
- [ ] Swirl the parts around artistically with open simplex noise
- [ ] Look at a bunch of different machines that would be cool to explode
- [ ] Explode extent controls

## TODO:
- [x] Test simple setup
- [x] Write modelWrangler class
- [x] Import simplex-noise
- [x] Reading and storing positional data from the scene for each model
- [x] Mutiply position vectors to get
- [x] Lerp between initial and target 
- [x] Easing function
- [x] Cool swirly motion for whole group
- [x] getNoiseVal function
- [x] Test the code still works for my typewriter mockup model
- [x] Set targets to random
- [x] Fix weird error that turned out to be a mistaken export thing
- [x] Ooft wrap some of it in p5js so it works in OpenProcessing
- [x] lil-gui biz


# ðŸªµDev LogðŸªµ

## 2025-03-29 Threejs exploded view
  - Test: export a simple scene from Blender
    - Store initial positions
    - Calculate target positions
    - Do a cool swirly and lerp between exploded and assembled states
  
  ![Basic scene as a test](/assets/images/2025-03-30-WCCC-Basic-Scene.png "If I've learned anything, it's start REALLY simple and build on solid ground")
  
  - Realise after a couple of hours that OBJ exports don't embed positional data
  - Switch to GLTF
  - Get that working for really simple models
  - Struggle to get it working for more complex models imported from BlenderKit
  - Easing functions are fun
  - Begin work on making my own in Blender

## 2025-03-30 The Deadline approaches

   - Quick tests with applying transforms or resetting... not quite what I'm after
   - Hooray! Generating random targets works great and is close enough to what I'm after
  
  ![Test](/assets/images/2025-03-30_QuickTest.png "And THIS is why we test as we go.")
  ![Test](/assets/images/2025-03-30_QuickTestSuccess.png "FaaaaaaTASTIC")

  - Get it to run in openProcessing --> involved declaring my initial setup in p5js setup. Good to know!
