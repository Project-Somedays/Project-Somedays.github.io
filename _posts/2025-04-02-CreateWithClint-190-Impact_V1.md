## Stretch Goals/Extension Ideas

## TODO:
- [x] Sketch
- [x] Globe Sim
- [x] Globe cell fracture
- [ ] Learn how to impart initial velocity to an object
- [ ] Learn how to import initial velocity to a cell fractured object
- [ ] Fly path
- [ ] Fly model
- [ ] Fly animation
- [x] Learn about shapekeys
- [ ] Setting: Grassy Knoll on Olympus?

# 🎓Lessons Learned🎓
- Collections is how the physics sim knows which objects should interact
- Substeps per frame: 130, Solver interations: 40
- If you start objects overlapping, everything freaks out
- Convex hulls don't fit convex parts of 3D models very well


# 🪵Dev Log🪵

## 2025-04-02 Frist Steps - Isolate skills 🕒2hrs
- Sketch complete - Set out the basic shots I want
- Found an Atlas model
- Played around scale... This was a mistake RE physics sims 😅
- Got thoroughly confused why my simulations kept exploding. Or doing zero things.
