## Stretch Goals
- [ ] Animation: finding Mario
- [ ] Animation: seeking comfort
- [ ] Animation: taking hat off

## TODO:
  
- [x] Block out scene
- [x] Find Mario
- [x] Rig Mario - first pass
- [x] Position Mario
- [x] Find Luigi? Peach?
- [x] Position
- [x] Model sewer pipe
- [x] Back Lighting
- [x] Water in the pipes
- [x] Drips and ripples in the water
- [ ] Sound design?
- [ ] Music?
- [x] Goomba model
- [x] Goomba Cordyceps
- [x] Render a gif
- [x] ~~Torch beams?~~
- [x] Subtle animation on goomba
- [x] Better lighting on Goomba face --> side lighting?

## Things I've learned
- Always start with the block out
- Wave modifiers
- Hair particle system
- Subsurface scattering
- I REALLY have to learn how to map Mixamo animations onto models

## 2025/03/25 🕒 0.5 hrs
  - Brainstorming and reference collecting
##  2025/03/26 🕒 3 hrs
  - Blocking out the scene
  - Experiments with Subsurface scattering on the placeholder things
  - Set scale and restarted
  - Modelled a simple torch and constrained it to the spot light
  - Luigi model posed (ish)
  ![Test Lighting 1](/assets/images/2025-03-26-SporesUpdate.jpg "Definitely worth doing a really basic blockout before getting bogged down")
## 2025/03/27 🕒 3 hrs
  - Add more geometry around Luigi's leg
  - Pose Luigi with the torch
  - Texture Mario
  - Find Lakitu model
  - Position with torch
  - Subsurface scattering on Mario's skin
  - Hair spores on Mario's skin
  - Initial render
  - Texure water material
  - Subtle Lakitu animation
  - Subtle lighting on Lakitu face
  - Subtle lighting on Luigi face
![Test Lighting 1](/assets/images/2025-03-27-SporesUpdate.jpg "Aha! The Goomba! Of course!")
## 2025/03/29 🕒 4hrs
  - Fixed textures of Lakitu Cloud
  - Add accidentally creepy eyes on Lakitu
