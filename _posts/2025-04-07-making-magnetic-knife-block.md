## Resources:

## ðŸŽ“ Lessons Learned ðŸŽ“
- Colanders are good for protecting drying epoxy from curious cats. They are, however, magnetic ðŸ¤£
- A thin coating of epoxy is very much best, followed by a good fine grit sand. Too thick it stays tacky.
- Don't let school children gather outside the vent of your laser cutter. Enough said. 

## Stretch Goals/Extension Ideas

## TODO:
- [x] Make profile of knives
- [x] Make profile of the magnets
- [x] Buy Magnets
- [x] Buy Wood
- [x] Cut Wood to size
- [x] Laser Cut Wood
- [x] Clean wood
- [x] Offset all paths by 2.5mm

## 2025-04-07 Smashing it out
  - Took a photo of the knives in the layout I want  
  
  ![Took photo of knives](/assets/images/making/2025-04-07-knifeblock/2025-04-07_KnifeBlock_Knives.jpg "The best reference is the thing itself")
  - Calibrate and trace in illustrator

  - Positioned the magnets and offset shapes

## 2025-04-08 Laser Cutting

- Laser at 40% power at a low feed to cut to 2mm deep: took off a LOT of material and released a fair amount of smoke but it was totally worth it for the nice clean recess. Originally, this was going to be an experiment in CNC, but the tightness of the corners was proving an issue.

## 2025-04-09 Epoxy work

- Just regular off-the-shelf Bunnings 2 part epoxy

- Got some help from a steady hand ðŸ¥°
