# Render Challenges

Nothing like biting off more than you can chew to upskill quickly! 

Have I spent more time than I can rightly afford on these challenges? Yes!

Do I learn more in these challenges than at any other time? Also yes!

## What are these Render Challenges?
The [pwnisher](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWIfzAYHyNSyHmT2AO-54yg) has an incredible community of 3D artists from around the world that come together to learn, create and showcase their incredible talennts. I'm a complete novice in the world of VFX and, while I've spent a fair amount of time creative coding and 3D printing, the waters are VERY deep here.

## Did you participate?
Yes! Did I make top 100 in either case? No! Did I also tackle something more than 80% outside of current skillset (against advice ðŸ˜…)? Also yes! I'm in the all Renders video though. And not in the "failed to meet the tech specs" section either. I'll consider that a big win.
