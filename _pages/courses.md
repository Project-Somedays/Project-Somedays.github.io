# Gemini from the Ground-Floor

The age of AI is upon us! I commissioned this course in prompt-engineering to help teachers learn how to leverage AI to get output they can actually use. Why bother? To free you up for the relational work that is actually teaching ðŸ˜Š

The course currently addresses the main big-ticket items in teacher admin:
    - Marking and Feedback
    - Report Writing
    - Programming and Lesson Planning
    - Assessment Tasks
    - Risk Assessments and Excursion Applications

Again, this course is free! We just need to collect registration data using this form: https://bit.ly/GeminiTeacherPD

# The Appsolute Beginner's Guide to Appsheets
Got an idea for an app? Don't know where to begin? Turns out Google has you covered! Appsheet builds on a google sheet backend to handle all your basic data entry needs. Couple this with a relatively light amount of scripting in appscript, and you can be VERY dangerous.
