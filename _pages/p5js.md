# What is p5js?

p5.js is a JavaScript library and a beginner-friendly tool for creative coding, designed to make coding accessible to artists, designers, educators, and novices. It's an open-source project that helps you create visual, interactive, and animated content right in your web browser. Built on the core principles of Processing, a language developed for visual arts, p5.js provides a comprehensive set of functions for drawing shapes, manipulating color, and handling user input like mouse clicks and keyboard presses.

- Browser-based creativity: Everything you create runs directly in a web browser, making it easy to share your work.

- Accessibility: With a focus on simplicity and a vast community, p5.js lowers the barrier to entry for coding.

- Interactive and dynamic content: It's great for making anything from simple sketches and data visualizations to complex games and generative art.
