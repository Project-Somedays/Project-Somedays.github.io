# What the heck is Creative Coding?
## Creative Coding: 💻✨

Creative coding is the art of wielding programming languages as a tool for artistic exploration. It's where logic meets aesthetics, producing digital experiences that transcend traditional software development. 🎨🚀

We use code to sculpt visuals, orchestrate sounds, and design interactive environments, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in digital art and performance. 🎶🌐

Think of it as crafting digital experiences with code, where the output is expressive, evocative, and often unexpected. 🤯

## Generative Art: 🤖🌀

Generative art employs algorithms and autonomous systems to produce artwork, where the artist defines the rules, and the computer generates the variations. 🌟

It's a process of setting parameters and witnessing the emergence of complex patterns and forms, often revealing intricate and surprising results. 🤩

Essentially, we're building systems that create art, exploring the potential of computational creativity. 🌸

## What languages do I use?
**p5.js (javascript/typescript):** ✏️ Your friendly neighborhood sketchpad! Perfect for quick, interactive 2D visuals and learning the basics. It's like finger painting with code, super accessible and fun! 🎉

**Processing (Java):** 💪 The OG creative coding powerhouse! Offers a robust environment for 2D and 3D exploration. It's like a well-equipped art studio, with lots of tools and depth. 🌀

**Three.js (javascript/typescript):** 🌐✨ Dive into the 3D realm! It's like building your own virtual reality sandbox, with stunning visuals and endless possibilities for immersive experiences. 🚀

## What should I use?

| Feature        | p5.js                                  | Processing (Java)            | Three.js                               |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Pros** |                                         |                                      |                                        |
| Ease of Use    | Very easy, beginner-friendly            | Easier than Three.js, but steeper than p5.js | Steeper learning curve, but powerful |
| Web Integration| Seamless web integration, browser-based | p5.js mode allows web integration    | Designed for web, excellent performance |
| Community      | Large and active community              | Large and mature community           | Large and growing community            |
| 2D Graphics    | Excellent for 2D, simple animations     | Excellent for 2D, robust features   | Capable, but not its primary focus    |
| 3D Graphics    | Basic 3D capabilities                 | Robust 3D capabilities              | Excellent, dedicated 3D library       |
| Learning Curve | Gentle                                  | Moderate                             | Steep                                  |

| Performance    | Can be slower for complex 3D scenes    | Java can have overhead, p5.js mode also has limitations | Can be complex to optimize for very large scenes |
| 3D Features    | Limited 3D functionality               | Steeper learning curve for 3D than 2D | Requires understanding of WebGL        |
| Dependencies   | Minimal                                 | Java Runtime Environment (Java mode)| Requires understanding of JavaScript, WebGL, and 3D concepts |
| Development Environment | Browser based or simple text editor | Java IDEs or p5.js web editor | Requires understanding of javascript development and build tools |
