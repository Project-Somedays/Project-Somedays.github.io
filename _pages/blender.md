# Render Challenges
## What are these Render Challenges?
The [pwnisher](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWIfzAYHyNSyHmT2AO-54yg) has an incredible community of 3D artists from around the world that come together to learn, create and showcase their incredible talennts. I'm a complete novice in the world of VFX and, while I've spent a fair amount of time creative coding and 3D printing, the waters are VERY deep here.

## Did you participate?
Yes! Did I make top 100? No! Did I also tackle something more than 80% outside of current skillset (against advice ðŸ˜…)? Also yes! I'm in the all Renders video though. And not in the "failed to meet the tech specs" section either. I'll consider that a big win.

## What are these weeklies about?
Apart from a month-long thing twice a year, the community votes on a different prompt every week. You can get ample feedback on your work. There are prizes to be won. It's a great time to be learning something new. Everyone there is super passionate and is about continual improvement.

## Where can I participate?
