Grabbing the visual syle of greek pottery.
My original plan was for a clone of QWOP but... in the time I have a quick-time guitar-hero style of game is going to be better.

## ðŸŽ“Lessons LearnedðŸŽ“
  - Matter.js Bodies.fromVertices()

```

var customCurveBody = Bodies.fromVertices(x, y, vertices, {
        // Optional: Add body properties like friction, restitution, etc.
    });
```

## Resources:
- "Typewriter" by Metro on Sketchfab: [https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/typewriter-c212b517cbdd4fa1930ed31a45670d39](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/typewriter-c212b517cbdd4fa1930ed31a45670d39)

## Stretch Goals/Extension Ideas
- [ ] Swirl the parts around artistically with open simplex noise
- [ ] Look at a bunch of different machines that would be cool to explode
- [ ] Explode extent controls

## TODO:
- [ ] Hill
  - [x] Nice well-defined sine curve
  - [x] Colour scheme
  - [ ] Scrolling enabled
- [ ] Controls
  - [ ] Window of time
  - [ ] Generation
  - [ ] Scrolling
  - [ ] Detection
- [ ] UI
  - [ ] Oomph
  - [ ] Quicktime biz
- [ ] Boulder
  - [ ] Generation using 2D noise
- [ ] IK
  - [ ] Hands on boulder
  - [ ] Feet on hill

Simplifications:
 - Make the boulder perfectly round
 - Make the hill from a bunch of rectangles?
